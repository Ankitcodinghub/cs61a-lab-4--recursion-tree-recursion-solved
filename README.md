Topics

Consult this section if you need a refresher on the material for this lab. It‚Äôs okay to skip directly to the questions and refer back here should you get stuck.

Recursion

A recursive function is a function that calls itself in its body, either directly or indirectly.

Let‚Äôs look at the canonical example, factorial.

Factorial, denoted with the ! operator, is defined as:

n! = n * (n-1) * ‚Ä¶ * 1

For example, 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120

The recursive implementation for factorial is as follows:

py def factorial(n): if n == 0: return 1 return n * factorial(n ‚Äì 1)

We know from its definition that 0! is 1. Since n == 0 is the smallest number we can compute the factorial of, we use it as our base case. The recursive step also follows from the definition of factorial, i.e., n! = n * (n-1)!.

Recursive functions have three important components:

1. Base case. You can think of the base case as the case of the simplest function input, or as the stopping condition for the recursion. In our example, factorial(1) is our base case for the factorial function.

2. Recursive call on a smaller problem. You can think of this step as calling the function on a smaller problem that our current problem depends on. We assume that a recursive call on this smaller problem will give us the expected result; we call this idea the ‚Äúrecursive leap of faith‚Äù. In our example, factorial(n) depends on the smaller problem of factorial(n-1).

3. Solve the larger problem. In step 2, we found the result of a smaller problem. We want to now use that result to figure out what the result of our current problem should be, which is what we want to return from our current function call. In our example, we can compute factorial(n) by multiplying the result of our smaller problem factorial(n-1) (which represents (n-1)!) by n (the reasoning being that n! = n * (n-1)!).

The next few questions in lab will have you writing recursive functions. Here are some general tips:

Paradoxically, to write a recursive function, you must assume that the function is fully functional before you finish writing it; this is called the recursive leap of faith.

Consider how you can solve the current problem using the solution to a simpler version of the problem. The amount of work done in a recursive function can be deceptively little: remember to take the leap of faith and trust the recursion to solve the slightly smaller problem without worrying about how.

Tree Recursion

A tree recursive function is a recursive function that makes more than one call to itself, resulting in a tree-like series of calls.

For example, let‚Äôs say we want to recursively calculate the nth Virahanka-Fibonacci number, defined as:

py def virfib(n): if n == 0 or n == 1: return n return virfib(n ‚Äì 1) + virfib(n ‚Äì 2)

Calling virfib(6) results in the following call structure that looks like an upside-down tree (where f is virfib):

Each f(i) node represents a recursive call to virfib. Each recursive call f(i) makes another two recursive calls, which are to f(i-1) and f(i-2). Whenever we reach a f(0) or f(1) node, we can directly return 0 or 1 rather than making more recursive calls, since these are our base cases.

In other words, base cases have the information needed to return an answer directly, without depending upon results from other recursive calls. Once we‚Äôve reached a base case, we can then begin returning back from the recursive calls that led us to the base case in the first place.

Generally, tree recursion can be effective for problems where there are multiple possibilities or choices at a current state. In these types of problems, you make a recursive call for each choice or for a group of choices.

Required Questions

What Would Python Do?

Q1: Squared Virahanka Fibonacci

Use Ok to test your knowledge with the following ‚ÄúWhat Would Python Display?‚Äù questions:

python3 ok -q squared-virfib-wwpd -u

‚Äú`py

def virfib_sq(n): print(n) if n &lt;= 1: return n return (virfib_sq(n ‚Äì 1) + virfib_sq(n ‚Äì 2)) ** 2 r0 = virfib_sq(0)

r1 = virfib_sq(1)

r2 = virfib_sq(2)

r3 = virfib_sq(3)

r3

(r1 + r2) ** 2

r4 = virfib_sq(4)

Parsons Problems

python3 parsons

Q2: Line Stepper

For example, here is a visualization of all possible paths if we start at 3 on the number line with 5 steps. At every step, we move either one step to the left of right, and we ultimately end each path at 0.

‚Äú`py def line_stepper(start, k): ‚Äú‚Äù‚Äù Complete the function line_stepper, which returns the number of ways there are to go from start to 0 on the number line by taking exactly k steps along the number line.

&gt;&gt;&gt; line_stepper(1, 1)

&gt;&gt;&gt; line_stepper(0, 2)

Code Writing Questions

Q3: Summation

Write a recursive implementation of summation, which takes a positive integer n and a function term. It applies term to every number from 1 to n including n and returns the sum.

Important: Use recursion; the tests will fail if you use any loops (for, while).

‚Äú`py def summation(n, term): ‚Äú‚Äù‚ÄùReturn the sum of numbers 1 through n (including n) w√Éth term applied to each number. Implement using recursion!

&gt;&gt;&gt; summation(5, lambda x: x * x * x) # 1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 + 4^3 + 5^3 225

&gt;&gt;&gt; summation(9, lambda x: x + 1) # 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 54

&gt;&gt;&gt; summation(5, lambda x: 2**x) # 2^1 + 2^2 + 2^3 + 2^4 + 2^5

&gt;&gt;&gt; # Do not use while/for loops!

&gt;&gt;&gt; from construct_check import check

Q4: Insect Combinatorics

Consider an insect in an M by N grid. The insect starts at the bottom left corner, (1, 1), and wants to end up at the top right corner, (M, N). The insect is only capable of moving right or up. Write a function paths that takes a grid length and width and returns the number of different paths the insect can take from the start to the goal. (There is a closed-form solution to this problem, but try to answer it procedurally using recursion.)

For example, the 2 by 2 grid has a total of two ways for the insect to move from the start to the goal. For the 3 by 3 grid, the insect has 6 diferent paths (only 3 are shown above).

Hint: What happens if we hit the top or rightmost edge?

‚Äú`py def paths(m, n): ‚Äú‚Äù‚ÄùReturn the number of paths from one corner of an M by N grid to the opposite corner.

Optional Questions

Q5: Pascal‚Äôs Triangle

Pascal‚Äôs triangle gives the coefficients of a binomial expansion; if you expand the expression (a + b) ** n, all coefficients will be found on the nth row of the triangle, and the coefficient of the ith term will be at the ith column.

Here‚Äôs a part of the Pascal‚Äôs trangle:

1 1 1 1 2 1 1 3 3 1 1 4 6 4 1

Every number in Pascal‚Äôs triangle is defined as the sum of the item above it and the item above and to the left of it. Rows and columns are zeroindexed; that is, the first row is row 0 instead of 1 and the first column is column 0 instead of column 1. For example, the item at row 2, column 1 in Pascal‚Äôs triangle is 2.

py def pascal(row, column): ‚Äú‚Äù‚ÄùReturns the value of the item in Pascal‚Äôs Triangle whose position is specified by row and column. &gt;&gt;&gt; pascal(0, 0) 1 &gt;&gt;&gt; pascal(0, 5) # Empty entry; outside of Pascal‚Äôs Triangle 0 &gt;&gt;&gt; pascal(3, 2) # Row 3 (1 3 3 1), Column 2 3 &gt;&gt;&gt; pascal(4, 2) # Row 4 (1 4 6 4 1), Column 2 6 ‚Äú‚Äù‚Äù ‚Äú*** YOUR CODE HERE ***‚Äù
